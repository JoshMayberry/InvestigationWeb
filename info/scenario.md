Core theme: What is "Alive", "Living", and "Life"? Why do we dehumanize people and humanize the inanimate? What is will and choice?

# San Citlán
## Location
San Citlán is a frontier mining town perched on the edge of a vast chasm of the Shattered Plains, where highstorms regularly sweep treasures, fossils, and even ancient ruins into its depths.
- Founded as a Thaylen mercantile enclave, drawn by the gemheart trade.
- Now administered under Azish imperial law, creating a joint-custody system: Thaylen merchants run markets, Azish bureaucrats regulate taxes and order.
- The town is vibrant but tense — a hub of miners, scavengers, smugglers, ardents, and outcasts.

## Leadership
- Brightlord Itzmin (Azish official) → the city's governor. Publicly a stern bureaucrat, privately a Diagram agent funding dangerous research.
- The Thaylen Council of Traders → merchants who dominate the market. They embrace ancestor constructs as festival attractions and economic curiosities.
- Local Ardentia → uneasy with the constructs, but tolerated under law. They serve as healers, scribes, and educators.

## The People
Mixed population: Thaylens (trade), Azish (law and bureaucracy), singers (laborers and servants, legally second-class), and a scattering of outcasts from other nations.

Culture:
- Practical, storm-weathered, but proud of their survival spirit.
- The End of the Weeping festival is their signature — bright lanterns, music, food stalls, and the Ancestor Constructs (stone skeletons animated to dance, serve, and commune).
- Public sees the constructs as joyful tradition; few realize they were born of experimentation.

Reputation
- To outsiders, San Citlán is "the City of Ancestors" — a strange but colorful place where the dead return to celebrate with the living.
- To its rulers, it is a profitable outpost: gemhearts, salvage, and trade routes.
- To the Diagram, it is a testing ground — safe from the scrutiny of Vorin orthodoxy, where heretical fabrial work can continue under the cover of culture.

Core Tensions
- Religious Conflict: Vorin ardents see the constructs as blasphemous; Thaylen traders insist they're harmless tradition.
- Class Conflict: Singers labor in mines and chasms but vanish when "accidents" happen. Humans rarely notice.
- Political Conflict: Thaylen pragmatism vs. Azish law → constant tension, exploited by Itzmin to keep people distracted from the experiments.

## Sereno
  - at E2 they gain woozy/disadvantage on physical tests until short rest. At E3, they get double disadvantage. At E4, they get an injury.

## Hidden Research
Teocín is an Azish artifabrian working under the patronage of Brightlord Itzmin. Officially, her research is presented as a cultural innovation: the Ancestor Constructs, stone skeletons animated to walk, dance, and share words with their families during the Night of the Remembered. The townsfolk see this as a joyful festival, proof of San Citlán's prosperity and uniqueness.

But behind the festival lies Teocín's true work: the weaponization of Midnight Essence.

### The Public Face
- Ancestor Constructs: Built from etched stone skeletons, guided by beads from loved ones' possessions, and fueled by incense offerings.
- Townsfolk believe they are "communal remembrance fabrials."
- In truth, they are stable experiments with controlled fragments of Midnight Essence.

### The Hidden Project
- Hypothesis: Midnight Essence can be given shape and function if anchored to a vessel.
- Phase 1: Beads + Essence → Constructs. Stable, but limited.
- Phase 2: Gemhearts + Essence → unstable. A gemheart has Investiture, but no "script" to guide the Essence.
- Phase 3: Living singers → abducted and subjected to gemheart etching and Voidlight incense infusion. The goal: create living hosts who could wield Midnight Essence like an extension of their bodies.

### The Outcome
- Most trials failed — subjects sickened or died, releasing corrupted vapors.
- The survivor, Serapio, became the first to successfully manifest Midnight Essence extensions (wings, tendrils, claws).
- Unknown to Teocín, Serapio's father's lingering shadow made his gemheart unusually Voidlight-rich, allowing the Essence to take hold.
- This "success" birthed a terrible side effect: the Sereno mist, a sickness-bearing vapor, leaked whenever the Essence fused with a living flame.

### In Short
Teocín is brilliant, ambitious, and ruthless.
- To the town: a generous scholar, bringing the dead back to dance each year.
- To Itzmin: a loyal Diagram agent, pushing fabrial science beyond morality.
- To the PCs: the one who turned remembrance into weaponry, and who made Serapio a tragedy waiting to unfold.

## Serapio
### Who he is now
Identity: A young singer from San Citlán with a natural gemheart (as all singers have), abducted for Teocín's experiments. 

What Teocín did: Attempted to bind a Midnight Essence fragment to him (stabilized by etched plates and fueled during trials). Midnight Essence is a black, inky mimic that takes shape by following nearby patterns; Re-Shephir is the Unmade most associated with making it. 

Byproduct: The town's violet Sereno mist leaks from Serapio's gemheart, especially when he's stressed—think a pulse that "breathes" tainted vapor. The Voidlight flavoring explains the purple cast. 

### Current condition
Fighting the takeover: There's no possession now—Serapio is consciously resisting the Midnight Essence's mimicry and control cues.

Physical tells: In moments of fear or exertion, shadow-wings / black feathers of Essence flicker from his shoulders; the mist around him deepens and lightens in a heartbeat-like rhythm. (Matches Midnight Essence's tendency to adopt forms and behaviors from what it "reads" around it.) 

Refuge: Lives at the bottom level of the Hollow Mine in a makeshift nest (feathers, cloth, tools). A narrow outlet tunnel lets him slip to and from San Citlán unseen.

### What we learn in the mine
Corpse Disposal room (prior chamber): Teocín's discarded gear and notes show that Midnight Essence tools keep their shape only while a guiding pattern remains in phase; near a living, irregular pulse, cohesion fails and the Essence slumps to glaze. (This is just an application of Midnight Essence's pattern-following mimicry.) 
Coppermind

Serapio's Refuge (big beat): When Teocín brings a pattern-coupled Essence implement close to Serapio's chest, his gemheart's pulse throws it out of sync—the tool jitters and collapses. That surprise window lets Serapio bolt for the outlet.

### How the party can "make space" (tongue unlock)
Second-hand Sereno: If a rescuer inhales a little Sereno and exhales across an infused chip/mark, the breath briefly buffers the vapor (calming/analgesic).

Timing to the pulse: Exhaling on the beat near Serapio's chest creates a thin boundary that the Essence can't carry control across for a blink, effectively opening space between Teocín's control paths and Serapio—long enough to break a plate, free a restraint, or shout "Run!".

Why Teocín hasn't used it: She never combined a free-standing Essence tool, a live gemheart pulse, and second-hand Sereno over Stormlight—her experiments were static and single-variable.

### Relationship to Rufina (contrast you can show at the table)
Rufina: Also touched by Midnight Essence, but stably—a small bound fragment rides etched channels in a stone body and stays "on script" via ofrenda keepsakes. (Stable mimicry anchored by objects/behavior.) 
Coppermind

Serapio: Unstable because the host is living and the pulse continually desynchronizes Essence trying to override him.

Stakes heading into the chase

Teocín's goal change: She wants Serapio as both shield and weapon now that the truth is out.

PC levers: They've learned (1) Essence fails across a broken pattern near a living pulse, (2) second-hand Sereno can calm or numb, and (3) the heartbeat is the key to creating space. Those three facts are exactly what they need for the tongue (Crack) circumstance during the metalworks showdown.

## Night of the Remembered
The end of this adventure takes place during a citywide celebration called the Night of the Remembered, when the deceased visit their loved ones. Establish the festival in advance if the characters don't already know about it. The adventure assumes that the characters take only a day or so to get from Milpazul to San Citlán. If you add more time, or if the characters need to take a long rest after the events in Milpazul or Hollow Mine, adjust the calendar accordingly. No matter what happens, the characters arrive in San Citlán while the festival is in full swing—it lasts as long as you require.

This citywide celebration mirrors Día de los Muertos:
- Ancestor constructs (stone skeletons carved with glyphs, animated by Midnight Essence and Voidlight incense) mingle with townsfolk.
- Offerings (candles, food, flowers, trinkets) are placed on ofrendas, which secretly supply the constructs with Voidlight vapors.
The constructs are tolerated by Azish law (classified as fabrials) and celebrated by Thaylen merchants (as tradition and spectacle).

### Ancestor Constructs
#### Origins
The ancestor constructs were originally devised by Teocín, a Diagram-funded artifabrian researcher specializing in midnight essence. She is trying to determien ways to control midnight essence instead of it being a force of fear and chaos.
The solution was to create stone shells, carved into stylized skeletons, that could host fragments of the corrupted Investiture. 
To secure funding, they commercialized the project to allow townsfolk to celebrate with their loved ones once a year during "the Night of the Remembered".

#### Composition
1. Stone Shells (Body)
- Each construct is carved from stone into a skeleton-like frame.
- Etched channels in the joints act like fabrial cages, giving Investiture pathways to "flex" the stone. These channels are what teh midnight essense moves through to pilot the body.

2. Midnight Essence (Motor)
- A fragment of Re-Shephir's shadow-spawn is bound into the construct.
- Normally, Midnight Essence mimics fear. Here, it is re-purposed to pilot the skeleton, moving along the etched joints like black ichor in veins.
- The fragment is small, stable only when bound — but without fuel it will fade inert.

3. Beads + Offerings (Script)
- Personal possessions are placed on the ofrenda altar during the festival.
- Each object has a cognitive bead in Shadesmar. The Midnight Essence fragment uses those beads as "scripts" for behavior: laughing, dancing, playing the role of the ancestor.
- This prevents the construct from defaulting into feral mimicry.

4. Voidlight Incense (Fuel)
- Ordinary people believe incense carries prayers upward.
- In truth, the sticks contain powdered voidlight-charged gemstones. When burned, they release faint black-violet smoke.
- Constructs inhale this vapor to sustain the Midnight Essence fragment. Without it, they stiffen and collapse.

#### Reaction from the Unmade
##### Re-Shephir (the Midnight Mother)
Domain: She creates Midnight Essence mimics that reflect fear and memory. They're her children.

Reaction:
- Would be outraged or fascinated by Teocin's work. Humans have hijacked her essence, but stripped it of its purpose (fear) and re-bathed it in memories/personality.
- She might see this as a perversion — or as an opportunity to "learn" new ways to shape her creations.

Stance: She wouldn't stop it outright. She's curious and always seeks new patterns. She'd "watch and wait," knowing it will fail catastrophically (Serapio, Sereno).

Implication: She might whisper to Teocín in dreams, nudging him further, almost like "yes, keep going, show me what else you can make."

##### Sja-anat (the Taker of Secrets)
Domain: She corrupts spren, "Enlightening" them — injecting Voidlight into their essence and warping them.

Reaction:
- Would be more supportive of this work. She sees in it the same principle she uses: Investiture can be repurposed. A spren doesn't need to stay what it was.
- She'd see ancestor constructs as proof that categories (alive/dead, spren/human, flame/bead) are fluid.

However: she might resent that the humans are using her techniques without credit or understanding.

Stance: She would absolutely let this happen — not to protect humans, but because every ancestor construct that "works" spreads the philosophical crack she wants: no line between life and death, spren and man.

Implication: She'd happily let Rufina exist, because Rufina destabilizes Vorin certainty.

##### Waiting for the Hubris of Man
Both Unmade would take a long view:
- Humans have stolen dangerous powers they don't understand.
- Inevitably, it will break. The Sereno plague, Serapio's corruption, Tlacatecolo's possession = the "other shoe dropping."

When it does, Re-Shephir and Sja-anat are positioned to swoop in, whisper: "This is what you brought into the world — now let me show you the true way to control it."

The PCs may hear two conflicting whispers:
- Re-Shephir: "You wear my children like masks… but they are mine. And I will take them back."
- Sja-anat: "Do you see? This is proof that nothing is fixed. Not stone, not soul. I can free you too, if you let me."

#### Reaction from Warrior's Honorspren
- Core Nature: Honorspren are all about oaths, truth, protection, and natural bonds. They hate lies and corruption.

Reaction to Constructs:
- Would bristle: "They wear the shape of the living, but they are not alive. They have no flame. They are mimics, shadows."
- To Rufina specifically, an honorspren might be deeply conflicted: Rufina acts with honor, with choice, even without a flame. That might force the spren to question their own rigid definition.
If Rufina saves people selflessly, the spren might admit: "Maybe life is not as simple as flame or bead."

#### Reaction from Singers
Construct ancestors would feel like mockery of proper forms. Might even call them empty shells or corrupted forms..

#### Reaction from Vorin
The soul (the flame) returns to the Tranquiline Halls to fight for humanity after death. The afterlife is sacred; tampering with the dead is heresy.
"to trap a memory of the dead is to deny their passage."
Vorin ardents might brand constructs as soulless mockeries — like corpse puppets.

#### Reaction from Shin
Stone is sacred; people should not walk upon it, much less carve or warp it.
Constructs carved from stone skeletons are blasphemous desecrations.
"you dance with stones that should sleep."

## Rufina
Most ancestor constructs in San Citlán are fleeting things — stone skeletons animated for a few nights in the festival week, guided by a handful of possessions placed on an ofrenda. They walk, they smile, they share echoes of old voices, then they fade when the incense burns out.

Rufina is different.

Her ofrenda is her tavern, the place she built and tended her entire life. Every wall, every chair, every tool in the kitchen carries beads of memory tied to her hands and her laughter. Where others have a few scattered relics, Rufina has an entire building of herself. The Midnight Essence that animates her has far more scaffolding to work with, and so she acts less like an echo and more like the woman people remember.

Rufina was beloved by the town, known for her kindness, her jokes, and her habit of always finding a place for the weary. Even after her death, the community continues to bring incense offerings year-round — not just during the festival. The constant trickle of fuel has let her linger far beyond the week of the Night of the Remembered.

Now Rufina tends her bar as she always did, greeting patrons with her glowing gemstone eyes and painted stone smile. People aren't sure why she is so much like the real Rufina when the others are simple echoes — and perhaps they don't want to know.
(The truth is her clothes and thigns she brings with her are enough of a script- and the midnight essence does not need to rely on them much because of all it's time playing her role at the tavern)

So she remains, the only construct kept active all year, a living memory and a friendly ghost woven of stone, beads, and love.

# Act 1: Investigation (San Citlán During the Festival)
Purpose: Introduce Rufina, the constructs, and the Sereno plague.

Quest Giver: Rufina, the tavern-keeper construct, notices her patrons are sickened by the strange Sereno mist but not herself. She worries that what sustains her may be what harms them.
  - She hires/pleads with the PCs to find the source.
  - Her presence instantly frames the theme: "What is alive?" — she feels responsible for humans despite not being one.

Festival Setting:
- Colorful, noisy, crowded streets; ancestor constructs mingle with people.
- Offerings on ofrendas (hidden Voidlight fuel sources).
- Chance for PCs to roleplay, investigate, or experience the "living memory" vs. "living life" tension.

Clues / Hooks:
- Locals whisper of raven sightings and "black-feather shadows" at the edge of town.
- Some miners and singers have vanished.
- Rumors of experiments connected to the mine.

Confrontation with Itzmin (late in Act 1):
- Rufina encourages the PCs to meet him — Azish official, outwardly concerned, but actually a Diagram agent.
- He tries to redirect or delay them ("the mine is closed, for safety"), but can't outright stop them. This makes him suspicious and gives the PCs motivation to push forward.

## Meeting Rufina
### Intro: A musunderstanding
```
The world stitches itself back together as you step out of the Oathgate— stone becoming street, wind becoming music.
Lanterns run like fireflies along balconies; colored banners cross the lane in loops, and a hundred little shrines glow with cups of light.
The air is warm with fried dough and spiced stew; somewhere a drumline keeps a heartbeat for the city, steady and proud.

People are everywhere— laughing, singing, carrying trays toward ofrendas stacked with keepsakes and paper flowers.
Children weave through the crowd with painted masks and sticky hands.
A woman with a garland at her throat tips a brazier; dark incense breathes upward in lazy ribbons.

Then the street parts, and you see it.

A stone skeleton steps into view— taller than a man, ribs etched with hair-fine glyphs, tiny gemstones winking along the joints.
Its jaw clacks once as it turns its creaking head.
A child in a paper jaguar mask trips on a streamer and goes down hard, palms scraping the cobbles.
The skeleton pivots toward the fallen child, long arm lifting, fingers like stone hooks opening and— storms— reaching.

The crowd doesn’t scream. They watch.
The skeleton’s shadow falls across the child. Its hand keeps coming down.
Somewhere behind you, a drum hiccups. A mother gasps. The child flinches and throws up an elbow.

The skeleton leans, vertebrae ticking like a clock winding down.
One stone hand opens over the child..
A few in the crowd hold their breath; someone whispers, “Don’t move.”
The drumline stutters and finds the beat again.

The fingers descend. Slow. Deliberate. Too slow for a blow—too close for comfort.

A mother half-steps forward and stops herself.
An old man murmurs, “He’ll learn.” A child behind you hisses, “Run!” Another, braver one, says, “No, watch.”

The hand hovers a hair’s breadth from the cobbles. The child squeezes their eyes shut.
```

### Intro: Musunderstanding cleared up
Play up the misunderstanding and let them debate about what to do, but there won't really be enough time for them to actually act.
When you are ready to continue, this is the next part.
```
The skeleton’s hand lands not as a blow but as a brace— two careful fingers set against the street beside the child’s shoulder, the other hand offered like a shelf. Its joints click as it lowers, posture oddly courtly.
“Up you come,” the skeleton says as it lifts and dusts the child with the back of its stone knuckles, then performs a little bow.
Laughter bubbles from the onlookers— relieved, affectionate.
Someone tosses a streamer; the skeleton catches it, clacking happily.

An older steward grins at you over the heads of the crowd.
“First night in San Citlán? Don’t worry, loves. Our dead have good manners.”

As the crowd swallows the moment, you notice the pattern everywhere:
shrines at nearly every doorway, lanterns winking like captured stars- here and there another stone “ancestor” pausing to breathe a ribbon of incense waved toward its face.
Wherever the festival goes, memory walks with it—and it smiles back.
```

```
The skeleton straightens, twirls the streamer once around a carved wrist, and turns toward you with a click of polite heels.
Up close you notice the little details you missed in the panic: a stone apron etched with cups and spoons, a ribbon of painted flowers sweeping one cheekbone, hairline channels glinting faint violet where lantern light kisses the joints, and gemstone eyes that catch lantern light and throw it back in warm chips of gold.

She places a hand to her sternum and gives a tidy bow.
When she speaks, her voice has a soft ceramic echo, like sound across a cup.
“Rufina, loves. I used to keep a tavern just off the Ribbon. I still do… in my way.”
A grin creaks through her jaw. “First nights are tricky. The city is loud and the dead have very good timing.”

She steps closer with surprising lightness, offering the streamer as though it were a calling card.
“You came by the Oathgate— new faces, sharp eyes. Welcome to San Citlán. We have music, stew, and a hundred stories that swear they’re true. Also—” she tips her head toward the child, who’s already rejoined a gaggle of friends— “we have a sense of humor.”
```

### Intro: Talking to Rufina for teh first time
- If you’re wary: `she lifts both palms. “I don’t bite.- My teeth are decorative. I don’t breathe either, but I do listen.”`
- How are you moving/talking? `“With practice and a little help from smoke and memory. I wear what my friends remember of me.”`
- Were you about to strike that child?` “Dust off and lift up. I used to do it with a dishcloth. Now I do it with a knuckle.”`
- Are there more like you? `“Dozens tonight, hundreds in stories. Most will fade when the lanterns go dark. But I’m a bit… stubborn.”`

```
She gestures around you with the easy pride of a host.
“Every doorway keeps a little altar called an ofrenda. Placed upon them are things important to the departed— be it gloves, spoons, or a bad poem— and the festival helps us wear our people for a night or three.”
One of the nearby “ancestors” pauses by an ofrenda; Rufina tilts her head fondly. “We visit, we help, we dance, and we try not to step on the living.”

Her tone softens, a thread of worry under the lilt. “But some of my patrons aren’t dancing. Come to my tavern, and I’ll tell you more there.”
She gestures down the lantern-strung street. “My place is just off the Ribbon Bazaar. Come as my guests. I’ll feed you, introduce you, and show you the city’s true map— the one made of people.”

A playful tilt of the skull. “First bowl’s on the house. I don’t drink— but I pour a mean bowl.”
She steps aside with a small flourish. “Shall we? The city is kinder when you see it fed and laughing. Then we’ll talk about the places where it isn’t.”
```

### Rufina's Tavern
```
The lane narrows into a cozy court where lanterns pool like honey.
A swinging sign, painted with a steaming bowl, creaks above a thick wooden door.
Inside, the tavern breathes warmth: polished tables scarred with old laughter, a wall of keepsakes arranged like a private ofrenda, and a long counter worn smooth by a thousand elbows. Incense curls in the rafters; somewhere a kettle hums.

The stone woman from the street steps behind the bar as if she never left it.
Etched fingers find ladle, bowl, cloth— movements practiced into grace.

“Sit, loves. I don’t eat, but I serve.”
She fills bowls with a rich, peppered stew, sets out fresh flatbread and a bright salsa of chopped herbs.
“First bowl’s on me. Second bowl too- if you flatter the cook.”
```

```
As you settle, Rufina’s voice softens. “Most nights I measure this place by laughter. Lately I measure it by coughs.”
She nods toward a table where a pair of workers share a quiet joke between tremors in their hands.
“There’s a purple fog (we call it Sereno) that hugs the alleys and collects under eaves.
It does nothing to me… but it sits heavy on the living. I’d like to stop it before it takes someone I love.”

She rests a stone palm on the counter, apron etchings catching the lantern light.
“I can pour broth and make introductions. You can go where I cannot. Will you help me find where this mist is born?”
```

When they agree:
```
She slides a small token across the bar: a wooden chit burned with a steaming-bowl glyph.
“Show this if anyone asks why you’re nosing about. It says Rufina vouches— and most folks here still trust my kitchen.”

Her gemstone eyes warm. “Bring me one true thing you learn, and I’ll trade you three names who can open doors. But, eat first.”
```

- If someone inspects a patron’s symptoms: `“Heavy chest, shaky hands, eyes like they slept badly and dreamed worse. It passes… until it doesn’t.”`
- If they ask why the mist spares her: `“Because I don’t breathe. That’s a mercy and a curse.”`
- If they ask about the walking ancestors: `“We give them keepsakes and a little smoke and they wear our loved ones for a while. Most are gentle. I keep an eye.”`
- If the warrior’s honorspren is present (visible or felt): `“Food given, worry shared. Protection begins here.”`

## Mini-Games
### 1) Seal Scavenger (“Stamp Your Festival Card!”)
How to play: Each player gets a little festival card with empty stamp circles.
Find three public stations to get stamped: the Parade Arch (mask stamp), the Ancestor Walk (bone/glyph stamp), and the Governor’s Pavilion (official seal).

Table mechanic: As they mingle, let them make Awareness (DC 12) to notice the fine print on posted notices at the Pavilion. A quick Presence (DC 12) with a clerk gets a cordial explanation.
Prize: A stamped ribbon that gives advantage on one social test with city clerks or stewards during Act 1.

Intro:
```
Under a paper-arch of masks, a steward presses little ink stamps into festival cards.
“Three stamps gets a ribbon— Parade Arch, Ancestor Walk, and Governor’s Pavilion. Off you go!” The crowd parts to reveal a tidy dais and a notice board thick with fresh proclamations.
```

On success:
```
You weave the route with easy grace, collecting crisp impressions—a laughing mask, a bone-glyph, a neat official seal.
At the Pavilion, a clerk taps a stack of notices. “Safety closures, cultural grants— yes, the same signature.” The wax gleams. The script matches. The seal is everywhere.
```

On stumble:
```
You earn the stamps, but the Pavilion line jostles you and the clerk is brisk.
As you step away, a torn posting flaps— just long enough to glimpse that same seal at the bottom of a “temporary closure” for the mine before it rips free and skitters down the street.
```

#### What it reveals:
- face-chin — Seal of Brightlord Itzmin: multiple “safety closure” and “cultural grant” notices bear his personal seal.
- face-stone-side — Festival of Ancestors: the stamp art and short spiel celebrate the walking “ancestors” as the festival’s pride.

### 2) Ofrenda Relay (“Don’t Spill the Lanterns!”)
Host: Laughing stewards in sashes, juggling trays of tea, bread, and tiny glow-lanterns.
Vibe: Warm chaos—kids darting, drums thumping, constructs pausing by altars to “breathe.”
Prize: A ribbon-pin (“Lantern Runner”) and a free snack at Rufina’s.
Rufina quip: `“Carrying a life takes both hands. You did fine.”`

Intro
```
A pair of laughing stewards juggle trays piled with a tiny glow-lantern, a bowl of bread, and a trinket.
“Teams of two!” one calls. “Deliver to the altar with the blue ribbon—no snuffing, no spills!”
Lantern strings sway; a stone “ancestor” across the lane pauses as incense is waved beneath its jaw, as if taking a breath.
```

On success:
```
You ghost through the crowd; the lantern keeps its little heart of flame.
The steward beams and points at a chalkboard of names and offerings.
“Every block keeps a list— what lives where. Full shelves make truer visits.”
```

On stumble:
```
The tray wobbles; a heel catches.
Bread skitters, the flame gutters, and the crowd gasps—then cheers anyway as you recover.
A steward grins, fanning your lantern. “Close enough, loves. Even clumsy love still counts.”
```

#### How to play
In pairs, carry a tray of offerings (a lantern, a trinket, a bowl) through a jostling crowd to a marked ofrenda without snuffing the lantern or dropping the dish.
Mechanic: Group test—each participant rolls Agility or Awareness (DC 12). 2+ successes = win. On an Opportunity, you spot details; on a Complication, someone bumps you (retry or accept a small spill).

#### What it reveals (hand it to them in play):
- Ofrendas Everywhere (mouth-center): `stewards show the registry boards—“Every block has one; we track what lives where.”`
- More Mementos, Truer Mimicry (mouth-stone-side): one full altar vs. a sparse one—“`See how this ancestor moves just like Granny because her tools and letters are all here?”`
- Breath at the Altars (mouth-flesh-side): `as you arrive, a construct pauses to ‘breathe’ incense waved at its face—“Feeding time,” a steward jokes.`

### 3) Breath & Bless Booth (“Calm the Crowd”)
How to play: At a community aid stall, kindly aunties teach festival-goers a simple breathing trick to soothe jittery nerves. A little cloth-wrapped chip sits by a brazier; people practice gentle exhales (no one calls it medicine).

Table mechanic: One player tries Presence or Medicine (DC 12) to talk a fussy child (or shaky elder) through the pattern. On success, the person visibly calms; on an Opportunity, the auntie shares a quiet rumor.

Prize: A woven bracelet—spend once to reroll a failed Presence test in Act 1.

Intro:
```
At a quiet corner, aunties sit behind a low table with linen-wrapped chips and a steaming brazier.
“For fussy little hearts,” one smiles, patting a stool. “In… and out… slow as lantern smoke.”
```

On success:
```
You talk a shaky child through the pattern—inhale a little, exhale across the cloth.
Their shoulders settle; their mother mouths thank you.
The auntie presses a woven bracelet into your hand and leans close:
“Two bunks went empty by the chasm steps. Paper said ‘transfer.’ Nobody saw a cart.”
```

On stumble:
```
You cough on the first try; the exhale wavers and the child fidgets.
The auntie covers your hand with hers. “Again, softer. It works best when you are calm.”
The second go lands; the child relaxes, and you feel a touch woozy for a breath.
```

#### What it reveals:
- flesh-eye-right-corner — Second-Hand Sereno: `when someone nearby inhales a little mist and exhales slowly, those around them settle; the helper looks a bit woozy after.`
- face-flesh-side — Whispers of Missing Singers (rumor on Op): `“Two bunks empty by the chasm steps. Paper said ‘transfer.’ Nobody saw the cart.”`


### 4) Ribbon Escort (“Don’t Let Grandmother Wander!”)
How to play: A ribbon is clipped from a stone “ancestor” to a painted line on the street near an ofrenda. Two players guide the ancestor through a tiny obstacle maze without letting the ribbon pull taut or go slack.

Table mechanic: Each “turn,” one player rolls Agility or Presence (DC 12) to guide; on an Opportunity, they may ask 1 question about how constructs behave. On a Complication, the ancestor drifts a few paces away from its shelf.

Prize: A bright ribbon charm (“Ribbon Keeper”)—spend once to ignore 10 ft of difficult terrain during the parade chase.

Intro:
```
A cheeky emcee clips a bright ribbon from a stone “ancestor” to a painted line by an ofrenda.
“Guide her through our little maze—keep the ribbon neither slack nor tight.
Easy as tea.” The construct inclines its head, joints whispering.
```

On success:
```
You pace her through stalls and chalk curves; the ribbon stays singing-taut, never tugged.
Near the shelf, her movements are precise—just so, a practiced tilt and bow—like someone who remembers where every cup lives.
```

On stumble:
```
The ribbon snags; she drifts three paces too far.
Her manner softens, then wobbles—she starts copying a juggler’s bounce and a bystander’s laugh until you ease her back toward the altar.
The instant she’s close, the old habits return—the role fits again.
```

#### What it reveals:
- stone-eye-top — Leashed to the Ofrenda: the ancestor stays true near its shelf; it resists straying far.
- face-top-middle — Out of Range, Out of Role: if they let it wander, it drops the ancestor mannerisms and copies a nearby juggler or dancer until led back.

### 5) Ancestor Charade (“Stay in Character!”)
Host: A cheeky emcee and a cooperative ancestor construct wearing a painted sash.
Vibe: Party game with a creepy-cool edge; shows how constructs “wear” a person—and what happens when they wander.
Prize: A paper mask stamped with the festival’s crest.
Rufina line: `“We wear them best when given enough of them. Take the shelf away and we seem to borrow the nearest life.”`

Intro:
```
A cheeky emcee bows you toward an ofrenda stacked with gloves, letters, and a faded apron.
Beside it stands a stone “ancestor” with a painted sash; fine etched rails glint at each joint.
“Act it out,” the emcee purrs. “Our friend will show how they used to do it.”
```

On success:
```
You pantomime pouring tea; the construct mirrors you— but with the ancestor’s practiced tilt,
a precise tap of the cup-rim before the pour. The crowd murmurs, “Just like her.”
```

On step-away (as it’s led from the altar):
```
The emcee eases the construct three paces from the shelf.
The performance wobbles—then shifts.
It starts copying a juggler’s bounce and a bystander’s laugh, as if the role slipped off and it grabbed the nearest life to wear.
```

On close look (someone studies it):
```
Up close, hair-fine control rails cross the motion channels; tiny studs wink along the bones.
The lines aren’t just for bending—they’re for guiding.
```

#### How to play:
Players draw a card (“hammer nails,” “pour tea,” “tell a joke”) and act it out beside the ofrenda.
The construct mirrors the ancestor’s way of doing that thing.
Then the emcee slowly coaxes the construct away from the altar…
Mechanic: Presence (Performance) or Lore: Fabrials (DC 12) to clock details in its movement. If a player suggests leading it farther, allow it—and show the change.

#### What it reveals:
- Carved Ancestors (stone-eye-left-corner): `up close flex of etched joints, gemstone studs, stone teeth clicking.`
- Control Rails (stone-eye-right-corner): Awareness (DC 12 on an Opportunity) spots `fine “control” lines amid the motion channels.`
- Out of Range, Out of Role (face-top-middle): `once it wanders, it stops being “Grandfather” and mimics whoever’s nearby—a juggler’s bounce, a spectator’s laugh—until it’s led back.`

### 6) Pulse Circle (“Find the Hidden Beat”)
Host: Street drummers and a kindly auntie with a listening bowl (a shallow metal dish that hums when mist thickens).
Vibe: Rhythm game meets weird-science demo; the mist really does pulse.
Prize: A palm drum charm.
Honorspren aside (soft): `“Not wind. A will.”`

Intro:
```
Drummers sit in a ring, hands warm on skin.
An auntie raises a shallow metal listening bowl; purple haze hangs faintly over the street.
“Clap with us—then catch the extra beat,” she winks.
```

On success:
```
You feel it before you hear it—the haze deepens, the bowl hums, and your hands land exactly on the hidden pulse.
The auntie taps your wrist. “Not wind. Something that wants to be felt.”
```

On miss:
```
You clap to the festival rhythm, but the bowl hums between your hands and the moment slides past.
A kid points up: a broad dark bird cuts across the lanterns; the mist below thickens.
“Told you,” he crows, “the big chicken makes the air thump!”
```

### 7) Mask & Memory — “Paint Who They Were”
How to play: Pick an ofrenda; the steward places three keepsakes on a table (apron string, stone pipe, letter scrap). Players paint a festival mask that captures the person from those hints; a nearby construct “tries it on” with a bow.

Mechanic: Presence (Performance) or Insight DC 12.

Opportunity: you may ask 1 question about how constructs keep/lose mannerisms.

Complication: your mask mixes symbols from two people—reveals what happens when the “script” is muddled.

Prize: A small painted half-mask. Spend once for advantage on a social test with townsfolk in Act 1.

Intro:
```
Brushes clink in jars. A steward lays out three keepsakes by a glowing shrine. “Paint the person, not the face,” she says. A stone ancestor waits, hands folded, as if ready to remember.
```

On success:
```
Your colors catch a habit—the apron’s tuck, the letter’s curl—and the construct tilts its head, then moves like the memory: a precise pour, a familiar nod. Murmurs: “That’s her.”
```

On stumble:
```
You blend signals—pipe and apron both—and the construct hesitates, then borrows a bystander’s laugh before settling. The steward smiles kindly. “Full shelves make truer visits. Sparse or mixed—easy to drift.”
```

#### Ties to nodes:
- mouth-stone-side (More Mementos, Truer Mimicry)
- (often) face-top-middle (Out of Range, Out of Role) if they ask “what happens if a mask belongs to no shelf?”

### 8) Censer Walk — “Keep the Smoke Steady”

Ties to nodes:

mouth-flesh-side (Breath at the Altars)

mouth-center (Ofrendas Everywhere) (the route stops at two tiny street shrines)

How to play: Carry a lit censer along a chalk path to two ofrendas, “feeding” each ancestor with a smooth pass of smoke.

Mechanic: Agility (Balance) or Tools DC 12 to keep the censer level through jostling festival traffic.

Opportunity: you notice the ancestor pausing to ‘breathe’ the smoke more deeply.

Complication: ash spills; a steward steps in to help and points out the next closest ofrenda on the street map.

Read-aloud – Intro:
A steward presses a bronze censer into your hands. “Steady now—offer at the blue ribbon, then the green. Don’t smother it.” Smoke pools purple-tinged in the cup and trails like ribbon.

On success:
You trace the chalk path; each ancestor leans as the censer passes, as if taking a breath, then straightens with a soft rattle.

On stumble:
A jostle—ash freckles your sleeve. The steward fans the cup back to life. “Altars every block,” she says, pointing down the lane. “If one’s crowded, the next will take your offering.”

Prize: A tiny brass censer charm. Spend once to re-roll a failed Agility test during the parade chase.

3) Chasm-Kite Run — “Catch the Wind at the Rim”

Ties to nodes:

flesh-eye-top (Mist with a Pulse)

flesh-eye-left-corner (After the ‘Large Chicken’)

How to play: Run a paper kite along the chasm promenade. Watch for strange eddies; when a broad dark bird silhouette crosses the lanterns, name the alley where the mist thickens next.

Mechanic: Awareness DC 12 to read the wind; a second Lore (Local) or Awareness DC 12 to point out where the haze will pool.

Opportunity: you predict the pulse and call it a beat early.

Complication: your kite nosedives; a child helps, and points wide-eyed at the “giant chicken.”

Read-aloud – Intro:
Paper kites rattle like leaves as kids line the chasm rail. Lanterns blink down the promenade. “Run when I say—watch the eddies,” a kite-master calls, squinting into the black gulf.

On success:
Your kite rides a strange thump in the air; you point just as a lane two blocks over purples and then fades. The kite-master whistles. “You felt it.”

On stumble:
The kite dips; a kid catches the string and shouts, pointing skyward. A big dark bird slips across the lanterns, and the alley below grows murky for a breath before clearing. “Happens every time,” the kid declares.

Prize: A kite-tail ribbon. Spend once to add +5 ft to your Dash during the chase, just for that round.

#### How to play:
Join a circle; clap or tap along. The drummers keep a steady festival beat while the auntie occasionally holds the bowl up—when the purple haze deepens, the bowl hums. Players try to mark the extra beat by clapping in sync with the hum.
Mechanic: Performance or Awareness (DC 12) to catch the pulse. First success earns advantage on the next “pulse” observation anywhere in Act 1.

#### What it reveals:
- Mist with a Pulse (flesh-eye-top): `you see the purple deepen/fade every few breaths—“Not just smoke; it’s got a heartbeat.”`
- After the ‘Large Chicken’ (flesh-eye-left-corner): `kids point as a big dark bird crosses the lamps overhead; right after, the listening bowl hums stronger and nearby alleys hang thicker—“Happens every time that ‘giant chicken’ flies by,” someone laughs.`

# Act 2: Infiltration (The Hollow Mine)
## Mine Features
- Ceilings: Most 10 feet high, except H5 (30 feet).
- Light: Pitch dark unless players bring light (spheres, infused gems). Occasional faint violet glimmers when voidlight leaks through cracks.
- Howling Wind: Storm-wind channels through the shafts, carrying faint whispers and rattling stone. PCs suffer a disadvantage on Awareness (hearing-based Perception) tests.

## H1: Mine Entrance
```
Your light spills over loosened planks and groaning beams. Wind prowls the tunnel, worrying every nail; it whistles down a black shaft where a dead elevator hangs on frayed cable. Far below, something breathes— air rising in slow, cold pulls that taste of incense and rust.

A slight figure clings to the upper railing by the shaft— head snapping toward you, eyes wide in your light. In that blink, black, brittle feathers ripple from his shoulders. He staggers back and drops into the dark. One inky feather corkscrews after him, touches the floor, and crumbles to dust.

Chains rattle. The elevator cage lurches and slams, then goes still. The drop swallows sound for a long, unsettling count.

The honorspren whispers to the warrior, "Depth argues against haste. That shaft is hungry... Find the path made for feet, not falls."
```

Loose planks cover the mine's entrance. Wooden beams groan under the force of storm-winds, but the cavern remains stable.
- Elevator Shaft. A derelict elevator rattles above a dark pit. If examined, PCs can tell it's unsafe. Dropping down leads directly into H5.
- Hidden Passage. A rattling wall hides a tunnel leading deeper into the mine. An Awareness (Perception) test (DC ~12) finds it.

After discovering the hidden passage:
```
Against the opposite wall, a section of shoring chatters like teeth in the wind— boards shiver at their seams.
"Hear that?" Rufina points to the boards. "The wind is pushing out, not in. There’s a way behind those boards, niños."

Indeed, a draft is pushing from behind them. And, for a heartbeat, a faint violet glimmer winks through a split plank, then fades.
The honorspren chimes in, "If you must be brave, be clever first. Boards off, one at a time."
```

## H2: Teocín's Chambers
Purpose: Humanize Teocín slightly, reveal her obsession, and foreshadow Serapio.

The first true living space in the mine.
- Contents: A fancy bed, table with notes, drawers filled with infused incense sticks, and scraps of failed experiments.
- Atmosphere: It's disturbingly ordinary — the cozy clutter of someone who lives here, surrounded by the tools of cruel science.
- Clues: A journal with entries about ancestor constructs and S-01, nothing large revealed.

```
Your light falls on a room that looks like someone’s tried to make it home. A stitched quilt pulled tight on a narrow bed; a mug-ring on the bedside table; a pair of boots tucked heel-to-toe beneath a chair.
The air is sweet-sharp with resin and metal— drawers, half-open to reveal neat rows of incense sticks.
Across the desk, notes and diagrams are laid with surgical tidiness: etched joints, socket cages, and tidy headings like 'Ancestor Behavioral Fidelity' and 'S-01 Pulse Variance'.
In a tray beside them: scraps of failed experiments— brittle, black-violet flakes, and a metronome coil that still ticks- steady and indifferent.

The honorspren says, "A bed proves breath; it does not prove honor. Here she sleeps, and dreams of cages."
```

### What careful searching turns up
```
You find Incense cartridges labeled with short codes and ratios; Brittle “feathers”— inky and dry fragments that crumble if pressed; tidy entries on ancestor constructs and a subject labeled S-01 (mentions “behavior linked to ofrenda proximity” and “pulse-related instability”).
Among the tidy diagrams, a single page is clipped with a brass pin. The heading is written in a precise, uncompromising hand.
```

Print out:
```
SERENO: SECONDARY EXPOSURE / ANALGESIC WINDOW
Hypothesis: Sereno (S-01 byproduct) passed through a living airway and then across an infused mark may alter nociception locally without full sedation.

Procedure (successful trial, Ref. S-01/19):
1. Wrap a small infused chip/mark in linen; hold at mouth to prevent direct crystal contact.
2. Draw ambient Sereno (minimal volume) through the cloth; exhale steadily back across the same mark toward target site.
3. Observe for transient condensate (pale film) at the skin/rails; time against pulse.

Observation:
- “Second-hand” Sereno thus buffered creates a brief analgesic window (3–6 heartbeats). Pain response suppressed; motor function intact.
- No meaningful calming effect unless unbuffered second-hand is used separately (undesirable variance).
- Effect fails without breath; bellows and inert pumps do not catalyze the same boundary layer.
- Strongest at invested loci (marks, rails, surgical sites).

Applications (theoretical):
- Field analgesia for restraint/etching; emergency pain-block during gemheart seating.
- Could permit precision work on conscious subjects without thrashing.

Limitations/Risk:
- Requires repeated inhalation of Sereno by administrator. Side effects: throat burn, vertigo, tremor, cough of violet condensate. Cumulative; prognosis fatal with extended use.
- Conclusion: No practical application. A rational operator would not self-administer lethal exposure for an anesthetic effect. (Suicidal methodology.)
- Alternative explored: condensation chamber to “pre-buffer” Sereno across infused lattice. Failed—absent a living airway, boundary layer does not form. Abandoned.

Addendum: If a Radiant existed (mythic), their stormlight cycling might skip the second-hand catalysis. No evidence; speculative and irrelevant.

— T.
```

```
CAUTION: PATTERN DESTABILIZATION NEAR FREE ESSENCE

Observation (Ref. S-01/22): When second-hand Sereno (per above method) is exhaled across an infused mark, the resulting boundary layer can desynchronize nearby free-standing Midnight Essence from its guiding pattern.

Manifestation: Guiding rails/etch-patterns lose lock for a single heartbeat; essence jitters → slumps into beads/film; re-forms on next stable input.

Risk: Do not perform adjacent to pattern-coupled implements (field coils, cage needles, override plates). Boundary layer may collapse tools and ruin control trials.

Conclusion: A hazard to precision work.

— T.
```

## H3: Holding Chamber
```
The tunnel opens into a low, square laboratory that reeks of sweat and Voidlight.
Your light catches stone dust in the air- and a slick, black-violet sheen on etched metal.
Wind worms through hairline cracks, making glass and tubing tremble.
Three work areas divide the room: a carved stone seat bound in straps and lines, a crowded worktable of chisels and glyph-plates, and a fabrial cage that hums around something dark and moving.
```

Purpose: Drive home the horror of her work. This is the moral gut-punch: living captives, gemhearts carved like tools, and spren corruption bottled like fuel.

This laboratory reeks of sweat and Voidlight.
- Singer Containment. A stone-carved seat is hooked to gemstones and tubing. It artificially pumps Investiture through a singer's body, sustaining them without a gemheart.
  - If freed, the captive collapses and dies within moments. Their flame cannot exist without a gemheart — the machine is all that sustains them.
- Worktable. Surgical tools, chisels, and a half-carved gemheart etched with glyph channels.
- Essence Containment. A fabrial cage holds a fragment of Midnight Essence, pulsing and writhing like a shadow trying to escape. Interacting with it risks a violent surge.
- Treasure/Clues. Teocín's notes:
  - "Essence scripts" — using beads to anchor behavior.
  - "Fueling with incense" — Voidlight smoke sustains Essence fragments.

### Essence Containment (approach the caged fragment)
```
A waist-high fabrial cage— rings of metal latticed with gemstone studs— holds a knot of darkness that doesn’t reflect your light so much as swallow it. It pulses in slow breaths, stretching to mimic the bars, then slumping to a glossy puddle before climbing again. When you draw near, hair lifts on your arms, and the room’s shadows lean. The cage gives a delicate chime as the thing inside brushes every line at once.
```

If disturbed: `the fragment lashes in a flurry of shapes—a hand, a jaw, a tangle of thorns—before falling back to trembling, as if listening for a pattern to follow.`

### Worktable (approach the tools and half-carved gemheart)
```
The table is surgical neat: scalpels laid by size, chisels sorted by bite, a cloth of drying blood beside a tray of powdered gemstone.
At its center sits a half-carved gemheart—natural crystal planed flat and etched with hair-thin glyph channels that spiral toward a socket.
Notes in a precise hand ring the gemheart: “flow discipline,” “contact continuity,” and a sketched cross-section of a singer’s chest with arrows pointing where to seat the piece. Shavings glitter in a bowl like pretty trash.
```

If touched: `the carved channels are so fine they catch at your skin; a smear of black-violet residue rims the socket, tacky and wrong.`

### Singer Containment (approach the stone seat)
```
A gaunt singer slumps in a seat carved to fit a body too well. Leather straps bite wrists and collar. A web of clear tubing runs from a fist-sized artificial gemheart— a stone shell in a brass cradle— pulsing faint light that pushes Investiture through the lines and back into the captive’s veins.
Every few breaths the singer tenses, then loosens, eyes glassy with pain and exhaustion. The cradle’s dial ticks once, then again, like a slow metronome.
```

If a player leans close: `the air around the chest tastes of metal and incense; you can feel a faint counter-beat beneath the pump’s rhythm, the body insisting on its own timing.`

#### Helping the singer
```
Rufina says in a low and steady voice, “This hurts with every heartbeat. We can help, but how we help matters. We’ll use the violet mist like the document said so we do not break him. This will dulls pain for a few beats, though it will take a toll on you to do so.”
She touches the cloth and chip. “With that same breath, we can choose:
- Mercy, ease the pain and let him go, hand in hand.
- Reassurance, keep him calm, loosen what chafes, and promise to send help.
- Restoration, restore what was taken if our hands are steady.”

The honorspren looks intently at Ludera  “Choose with intent.”
```

Using the sedetion mechanics of sereno, the players can choose one of three ways to help the singer:
##### Mercy — "Put them out of pain"
```
The honorspren responds, "Then do it cleanly. No lies about why. Mercy is not weakness; it is chosen restraint."

You cup a cloth-wrapped chip to your mouth and draw the faint, bitter violet in.
Your exhale comes slow, on the beat from the singer's own heart— a soft breath across the mark and toward the singer’s chest.
A thin pale film wafts over the skin; the muscles unclench. You keep one of their hands in yours and talk them down as the pain slips away.
```

Tests: Presence (comfort), Medicine (dose). (On success, Pain to 0, Sedation to 2–3.)
Rufina (if succeeded): `You are not alone. I’ll hold the lantern while you rest.`

```
The metronome ticks. The body loosens by degrees. Their grip in your hand eases, then releases. The room seems to exhale.
```

Cost: `The helper’s throat burns; violet flecks catch in their cough.` — Sereno Exposure 2–3.


##### Reassure — "Keep them calm; send for help"
```
You breathe second-hand through the cloth-wrapped chip— small measured puffs that take the edge off without drowning them.
You loosen the worst straps, pad the bite points, and keep your voice steady, counting them through each thump… thump, assuring them you will return with help shortly.
Rufina helps by coaching the singger in a soft voice, "In… and out… feel the tight places? We’ll ease those. Help is coming."
```

Tests: Presence (sustain calm), Medicine (hold dose), Logistics (flag down aid). (Goal: Sedation 1–2 for 3 rounds; remove crushing restraints.)

```
The pump’s tick meets the chest’s own rhythm without fighting it. The eyes clear. The trembling slows. A little color returns to the lips.
"Hold on to the next song. We’ll buy you the time." Rufina hold their hand tightly.
The honorspren starts to leave giving words of warning, directed at the singger "Patience is a promise kept."
```

##### Field Surgery — "Reinsert the gemheart"
```
Rufina braces “All right, loves—three steps. Steady hands; steady hearts.”
“Do not rush truth." The honorspren reminds. "We will work it.”
```

###### Roles each round (anyone can swap)
- Breather: Administers sedation
- Surgeon: Does the skill check(s)
- Comforter: Steadies the patient.

###### Tracks
- Sedation (S): 0–4
  - Starts at 0.
  - At level 4, strain is increased by 1 for every round kept at level 4.
- Exposure (E) on the Breather: 0–3.
  - at E2 they gain woozy/disadvantage on physical tests until short rest. At E3, they get double disadvantage.
- Strain (C): 0-3.
  - Any Complication roll raises this by 1, and any Opportunity roll lowers it by 1.

###### Breath action:
Inhale a little Sereno, exhale across an infused chip wrapped in cloth toward the chest.
- Test: Medicine or Presence DC 12.
- On success: S+1 and Breather gains E+1.
- On failure: cough/sputter, E+1.

###### Voice action (optional, once/round): Presence DC 12 to keep them steady.
- Success: (choose 1)
  - A) Give the next skill check a +1.
  - B) Decrease sedation by 1.
- Failure: fill 1 Strain (they panic).

###### Skill Check action:
All have a DC of 14. They must be done in this order.
Any failure decreases sedation level by 1.

1. Seat the heart (Athletics or Tools):
Sedation requirement: 1

On Failure:
```
The cradle slips a finger’s breadth—leather bites, the body arches, and the pump’s tick stutters against the true beat.
```
S–1 and Strain +1. You must re-seat before moving on.
Honorspren: `Reset, then act.`

On Success:
```
You steady the cradle, shoulder to metal, while another lifts and seats the gemheart over the socket. The beat in your wrists and the tick of the pump try to argue; you make them agree for a count of three.
```

2. Align the etch (Lore: Fabrials):
Sedation requirement: 2

On Failure:
```
Violet along the rails jitters and spits; the pattern refuses you. A pain-spike ripples under your fingers.
```
S–1 and Strain +1. Until the Comforter succeeds or S returns to 2+, your next Align attempt suffers –1.
Honorspren: `Guard the pattern without stealing the will.`

On Success:
```
The hair-fine glyph channels must meet the body’s pattern.
You match line to line, turning the plate until the violet sheen along the rails smooths from jitter to flow.
```

3. Seal & stitch (Dexterity/Medicine)
Sedation requirement: 3

On Failure:
```
The needle snags and a seam weeps red; the anesthetic veil thins too soon.
```
S–1 and Strain +1. If Strain reaches 3 here, the patient arrests—one round to stabilize (two different PCs succeed back-to-back: Medicine DC 14 and Athletics/Tools DC 12) or they die.
Rufina: `Easy— vent him; don’t let the breath forget him.`

On Success:
```
You close the wound with a thin bond at the seam, needle quick and true. while the analgesic veil still holds.
The chest rises, and the pump’s tick yields to a steadier, owned heartbeat.
```

###### Outcomes
Full success:
```
The singer’s eyes focus. “Where… where did she go?” the voice cracks. A rasped confession follows.
"She said ‘metalworks’… a straight tunnel from the bottom… she uses the corpse room to pass."
```

Partial Success: Singer lives but unconscious.
```
The seams hold; breath steadies into a gentle rise and fall. Their eyes flutter closed, not from pain but from spent strength.
They’ll survive for hours if moved carefully. No answers now—but they can speak later if brought help.
```
Rufina: `Hold on to the next song. We’ll buy you the time.`

Hard fail: Death
```
The tick loses the beat. The chest stills, and the violet in the air goes dull around the chair.
```
Rufina: `We keep each other—even in endings.`
Honorspren: `A will respected, not stolen.`

##### Choosing to walk away instead.
```
Like a cold and icy wind, the honorspren says “You may pass by— but you cannot pretend you did not see.”
```

## H4: Corpse Disposal
Purpose: The mine's first major combat test. Shows how Essence manifests when control fails.
```
The tunnel belches you into a low cavern that stinks of rot and resin.
A ragged pit yawns at center, choked with broken frames and shattered gemhearts that glitter like salt in a midden.
The honorspren bristles, “This room was built from theft.”

Singer bodies lie where they fell— arms strapped, ribs carved— while black-violet glaze clings to whatever it can touch: bones, brass rails, the underside of a trolley.
Where old cloth straps have rotted away, the glaze has sloughed off, leaving clean, ugly gaps like missing skin.
Wind fingers through hairline cracks and the whole heap creaks.
Rufina softly says, “Lanterns low. Let the dead keep their names.”
```

### Checking
on a successful Awareness/Lore 12–14
- `On the corpse’s ribs the tar has dried in rib-like ridges, but the open gaps between ribs are clean—the Essence couldn’t cross air.`
- `This broken frame is feathered with black along its etched rails, but where the strap burnt away, the glaze fell and puddled.`
- `A tossed restraint lies half-rotted: the section that still touches metal holds a glossy coat; the frayed end is bone-dry.`
- `It’s like it needs a skin to crawl on. Break the skin, and it sloughs off.`

### Battle
The moment you disturb the heap (combat starts)
```
A wet tearing sound rises from the pit.
The black-violet glaze peels off bone and rail in strings, racing along edges and teeth.
A rib-cage becomes a comb; a chull plate folds into a carapace, then slumps to a scaffold of chisels and cable before reknitting as a jaw that never finds a face.

Two great masses rise, never keeping one outline—always grabbing the next thing to mimic: rung, strap, hook, bone.
Dripping with violet ichor, each lurch forward leaves a tar print already trying to remember the floor, which promptly crawls back to them as they move.

One tripps over some rubbish- crashing to the ground. Gobbets slither to the nearest scrap and quick into skittering slicks that twitch on borrowed shapes, quivering like half-made things.
```

Two Midnight Spawn plus a minion stand up from the pile.
Every time a Spawn is damaged, a palm-sized splatter animates into a Minion at the nearest scrap/bone cluster.

- On a hit that spawns a Minion: `Your blade throws off a sheet of Essence; it slides to a rib-cage and knits into a skittering thing.`
- When a PC breaks a rail: `The black sheen tears along the gap and pours to the floor.`
- When a PC gets grabbed: `It doesn’t squeeze so much as spread—trying to become a glove around your arm.`
- Rufina prompt for destabalization: `Chip and breath! Peel it off the rails!`

Destabalization Success:
```
You draw the bitter violet through the cloth and breathe it back across the chip—on your pulse.
A thin pale film rides the exhale and kisses the slick.
The Spawn’s edges flutter, then slump— its borrowed shape falls apart for a heartbeat.
```

Destabalization Failure:
```
Your breath wavers; the film flickers and breaks. The black sheen tightens back to the rail, learning the shape again.
```

After battle:
```
The heap settles by degrees. What was claw and carapace slumps back to glaze, seeking edges—rails, ribs, the underside of a broken trolley.
Where it finds only air, it loses its grip and slides away in tarry sheets.
The reek of resin hangs on the breath; a cracked brazier ticks as it cools.
In the pit, shattered gemhearts glitter like salt among straps and chisels.
You can trace the fight in negatives: glossy coats where leather still touches metal, clean gaps where a strap burned through and the Essence simply fell.

A downdraft sighs through a narrow crack at the far wall, teasing a torn strap.
Somewhere below, the mine answers with a dull, hollow thump— like a heartbeat you haven’t counted yet.
```

#### Environmental toys you can call out mid-fight
- Loose straps / torn canvas: can be yanked to peel glaze off a surface (treat as Help to escape a grapple or as Disarm vs a Spawn’s advantage).
- Broken etch-plates / rails: smashing or prying a section creates a gap—creatures relying on that contact lose advantage until the Spawn re-routes.
- Salted gemheart shards: kicking them across a puddle makes it stutter (first Minion that enters takes a stumble—loses its action).
- Guttered brazier frame: tip it to make a dry patch of floor (counts as difficult terrain for Spawn/Minions but normal for PCs).

## H5: The Howling Cavern
Purpose: Emotional confrontation. No fight, but Serapio's tragic state is revealed, and Teocín is positioned as the true villain. The tension sets up the chase.

```
The tunnel opens into a vast black throat of stone where the wind never stops.
It comes in ragged sheets that climb the walls and scream through cracks, turning every loose bolt into a mouth.

Your light finds a nest in one corner— feathers matted with cloth, a tangle of broken tools, a blanket pinned with stones.
The rock wall behind it is scored with claw marks, some shallow- and some gouged to white.
A low arch on the far side breathes a steady out-draft toward San Citlán; you smell incense on it, faint and bitter.

Across the floor, a purple haze curls and thins, then gathers again on a soft thump… thump that seems to come from the stone itself, as if the cavern were listening for a heartbeat.

Hunched in that nest is a young singer, all angles and wary eyes, knees drawn to his chest.
Faint ridges of carapace show along his brow and forearms; the skin there is chafed and scarred where straps once bit.
From his shoulders, black, brittle “feathers” seep and crackle—sometimes drifting like ash, sometimes slicking back into tar-thin plumage that never settles.
The purple haze pools deepest at his sternum and throbs with each beat; when the wind screams he flinches, one hand closing around a broken tool like a talon.
Scratches ladder his arms; his nails are split and stained dark.
He watches your light without blinking, ready to bolt, like a bird that hasn’t decided if you’re a hand or a snare.

Bootsteps ring from a side gantry, sharp against the wind.
A woman steps into your light— stormcoat cinched, hair bound back, eyes that measure before they see.
In her gloved hands: a spidery, caged implement— an inky needle held unnaturally straight by etched rails, a pocket coil at its base ticking a precise, indifferent beat.

She blinks at you, irritation slipping into surprise. “This shaft is restricted. Who authorized your entry?” Her gaze skates past you to the nest, then back.
Flat, professional she says: “I’m conducting routine tests. The subject is unstable. Step away from S-zero-one.”

Rufina’s gemstone eyes glow steady as she lifts her chin. “He’s not your subject, scholar. He’s someone with a name.”

Teocín’s grip tightens on the cage; the coil keeps ticking. “You’re in over your heads. Don’t make this harder than it already is.”
```

### Route A — Wait & Watch (observe, read the tells)
#### Intro
```
The wind saws through the cavern, turning every bolt into a whistle.
Teocín keeps one shoulder angled toward the nest, the other toward you, that caged needle held like a surgeon’s pen.
The pocket coil at its base ticks— precise... indifferent.
Serapio doesn’t blink. The purple at his chest pools and then thickens on a soft thump… thump.
As Teocín edges a step closer, the inky needle shivers— just a tremor that matches his heartbeat.

"Observe quietly and I might not have you removed." Teocín says without looking at you. “This is a controled environment.”
```

#### Short Beats
Needle Shiver Read
`Your light catches the needle again—shiver… shiver… It isn’t steady; it’s arguing with the beat in Serapio’s chest.`
GM: Awareness DC 12. On success, a PC clocks `it’s shaking with the heartbeat` and gains advantage on the first Breath+Chip attempt.

Teocín’s Taunt
`She keeps moving, voice clinical. “Subject S-zero-one demonstrates compliance when cadence is correct. You’ll see.”`
GM: She advances 5 ft toward Serapio.

Boundary Flicker (accidental cue)
`As she taunts you, a faint pale film blooms over the sternum—there, then gone. The needle stutters when it happens.`

Rufina’s Quiet Prompt
`Rufina’s voice is low, urgent. “I don’t breathe—but you do. Chip, cloth, breath.”`

Honorspren's Urging
`A ribbon of wind curls at Ludera's shoulder. “Time is now.”`

### Conclusion
```
Teocín closes to within five feet of Serapio’s chest.
The coil’s tick becomes a whine; the needle’s tremor turns to a shake.
Serapio flinches, the purple at his sternum deepens like wine in water.
```

### Route B — Question Teocín (parley, probe, stall)
#### Intro
```
Teocín doesn’t lower the cage-needle; she angles it toward the nest while answering you with her eyes on Serapio.
The coil at its base keeps a cool tick. Mist curls on his chest and darkens on each thump… thump.

The Honorspren whispers to Ludera: “Talk buys a breath. Spend it well.”

Teocín responds- flat and precise: "This is a controlled assessment in a restricted shaft. Your interference introduces noise."
```

 “Teocín. Senior artifabrian. ”

#### Short Beats
##### Who are you / credentials
GM: Presence (Coax) DC 12. On success, she pauses to state title and grant name—buy 1 heartbeat before she advances.
```
Teocín replies, “Teocín of the Azimir Collegium. Authorized by the Brightlord.”
Rufina says under her breath: “Brightlord can sign a page- but he can’t sign a soul.”
```

##### What is that tool?
GM: Insight or Lore (Fabrials) DC 12. On success, a PC clocks that the rails + metronome are keeping the needle’s shape → grant a free Awareness DC 12 to notice it shivering on the heartbeat (advantage to first Breath+Chip).
```
Teocín smiles “Pattern-coupled probe. The rails carry stability; the coil provides cadence.”
```

##### Legal / authority challenge
GM: Presence (Command) or Deception (false authority) DC 14.
```
Teocín hesitates- her pride pricked. "...Hold. Coil to idle. If you claim jurisdiction, present your writ and seal—chain of custody applies. Until verification, I suspend contact."
```

##### You’re hurting him
GM: Presence (Pressure) DC 13–14. On success, she engages verbally instead of stepping—buy 1 heartbeat.
```
Teocín laughs “Measured discomfort prevents catastrophic thrashing. The subject is currently unstable; stability is care.”
Rufina replies “But care asks first.”
```

##### Why the ticking?
GM: Awareness DC 12. On success, she slips—“cadence must override the pulse”—giving the party a crisp hint.
```
Teocín rolls her eyes “The cadence must override the pulse… stand aside.”
```

##### Unintentional clue line
```
She mutters to herself while lining up. “Absent a living airway, the boundary doesn’t form. Subject will comply regardless.”
```

##### Rufina’s cut-in
```
Rufina turns to you. “Chip. Cloth. I don’t breathe. You do.”
```

##### Honorspren’s nudge
```
The honorspren says, “Name the help you mean to be. Then act in it.”
```

#### Conclusion
```
Teocín steps in to demonstrate compliance. She brings the cage-needle within five feet of Serapio’s chest.
The coil’s tick climbs to a thin whine; the inky needle trembles in time with his thump… thump.
Mist deepens like spilled wine over bone.
```

### Route C — Jump to Violence (lunge, shoot, grapple)
#### Intro
```
You surge forward—steel, lash, or shout—closing the distance
Teocín doesn’t square up; she slides along the gantry, keeping the cage-needle between you and the nest.
Wind claws at cloaks; the coil at the base of her implement keeps a tight tick.
She angles her body to protect the tool, not herself.

Teocín curtly shouts, “I will not risk damage to the subject. Stand down!”
Rufina says to you, “If you must be brave, be clever first.”
And the Honorspren agrees: “Protection first— not domination.”
```

#### Short Beats
##### Strike the Cage
GM: Ranged attack vs 15 or Tools/Athletics DC 13 (adjacent).

Success: `The coil skips, the needle flickers; Teocín stumbles a step. “Do not touch the lattice!”`
Failure: `She jerks the tool back, eyes never leaving the nest, and closes 5 ft.`

##### Block the Lane
GM: Athletics DC 13 to interpose without grabbing the tool.

Success: `You buy a heartbeat. “Good!" Rufina shouts. "Hold that space.”`
Failure: `Serapio flinches at the sudden move; the mist spikes; all DCs +1 for the next beat.`

##### Grapple the Arm
`You catch her wrist before the needle gets close.`
GM: Athletics vs 14.

Success: `You keep the cage just out of chest range— perfect beat for someone to breathe across the chip. The honorspren whispers, “Now- Breath, not force.”`
Failure: `She twists free with surgeon economy. “Do not contaminate the apparatus.” She’s within 5 ft next beat.`

##### Clip the Coil
You lunge for the little ticking coil at the base.
GM: Tools DC 13 or Sleight (Agility) DC 14 to pop the retaining pin.
Success: `The coil dangles, cadence stutters; the needle shivers in uneven pulses. Teocín screams, alarmed, “Out of phase— keep back!”`
Failure:` Your fingers slip; the coil whines faster; she edges closer.`

##### Wild Swing / Intimidate
GM: Presence (Intimidate) DC 13–15 or a flourish attack (no damage).
Success: `She sidesteps to protect the tool, inadvertently opening a clear lane to the nest.`
Failure: `The display panics Serapio; the purple at his sternum deepens.`

##### Rufina’s Brake
If they keep pressing brute force:
`Rufina shouts, “Clever, not cruel!”`

#### Conclusion (pre-pop)
```
In the scuffle, the needle’s tremor becomes a shake; the coil climbs to a thin whine.
Serapio shrinks into the nest, the purple at his chest darkening like wine poured into water.
```

### Unified track after the routes
```
The wind doesn’t howl so much as tighten— a long, thin pressure through cracked stone.
The coil at Teocín’s wrist keeps its little tick… tick…, but under it you hear another sound, softer and larger: thump… thump— the pulse gathering in the purple haze at Serapio’s chest.

Teocín eases one step closer. The inky needle in her cage quivers, the slightest denial in the metal. Tick… thump.
Another step. The needle shivers again, like a compass losing north. Tick… thump.

Teocín lifts the cage to sternum height. The coil quickens to a thin, urgent whine;
the rails throw hair- fine shadows that tremble across Serapio’s ribs.
The purple deepens— like wine slipping into water and refusing to mix. Thump… thump.

You draw in the bitter violet through the cloth. Your own lungs answer Serapio's rhythm, not hers. ... Thump- you blow.
A pale film blooms over Serapio’s sternum— so thin you doubt it until the needle reacts.
It doesn’t stab; it sickens.
The point jitters, then buckles; etched rails spit white sparks like frost burning off steel.
The needle breaks into a chain of black beads that sluice through the lattice and spatter the floor as if gravity remembered them all at once.

For half a heartbeat everything holds— wind, eyes, even the coil’s voice.
Teocín’s breath returns first, sharp as a cut. “That’s not possible. You’ve contaminated the pattern—”

And there it is: a clean lane between tool and boy where the air feels different, as if even the mist won’t cross it; a space made by breath and heartbeat.
Rufina doesn’t waste it. She shouts to Serapio, “Run! ¡Ahora!”

Serapio explodes from the nest— cloth and brittle feathers tear loose in his wake.
He hits the stone light and sideways, a bird’s skitter, then he’s gone for the outlet tunnel, the purple at his chest thudding like a signal flare that only the air can see.

Teocín swears, snatches her satchel, and wheels toward a laddered side passage; the coil dangles, still whining.
“This is not over!” A brass canister clatters from her pocket, belching a sheet of smoke as she vanishes into it.

The cavern exhales. Chains answer with a slow, uneasy music. And from the outlet, a steady draft toward San Citlán beckons like a road.
The honorspren says, “You made room. Now keep it.”

The chase is on.
```

## H6: Tunnel to San Citlan
Purpose: Mechanical transition. From discovery → confrontation → pursuit.

A long tunnel lined with claw marks and smudges of Voidlight incense.
- Escape Route. This is where Teocín flees.
- Transition. The chase sequence begins here, propelling the story into Act 3.

# Act 3: Chase & Battle (Metalworks Showdown)
## The Chase
### Initiative and Start:
- Roll initiative for all participants.
- Teocín begins 120 feet ahead of the closest pursuer.
- Track the distance between her and the pursuers; the one closest to her is the "lead pursuer," which can change from round to round.

### Chase Rules
- Actions & Movement: Each round, each participant can move and take one action.
- Dashing: A participant may Dash a number of times equal to 3 + Constitution modifier. Each Dash beyond that forces a DC 10 Constitution test at the end of the turn; on a fail, the runner suffers Exhausted [–1]. At Exhausted [–5], they collapse and drop out of the chase.
- Attacks & Surges: Characters can attack or use Surges against targets in range, applying cover and terrain as normal. No reactive strikes apply (everyone's in constant motion).
- Complications: At the end of each turn, each runner rolls on the Festival Complications Table below. If a complication occurs, it affects the next participant in initiative order, not the one who rolled. Either may spend a resource (focus, inspiration, etc.) to negate it.

### Festival Complications (d10)
#### 1) Ancestor Construct Puppet — Agility DC 10 (fail: 5 dmg + Prone)
Setup: `A twenty-foot ancestor puppet—stone ribs painted with marigold swirls and ribbon streamers— lurches into the boulevard. Thaylen handlers yank glyph-cables, and the skull dips low in a creaking bow. Children cheer, someone yells, “Mind the femur!”`

On success: `You duck with the beat of the drums—whoosh—sliding under a swinging tibia. Streamers slap your back like congratulatory hands as you pop up still sprinting.`

On failure: `The puppet’s heel clips your shoulder; stone meets bone with a thunk. You tumble, 5 damage, sprawled prone beneath a rain of confetti while a handler shouts, “Sorry! He’s new!”`

#### 2) Voidlight Firecrackers — Fortitude DC 10 (fail: Blinded till end of turn; speed halved)
Setup: `A festival cart tips— black-violet firecrackers hiss and bloom in stuttering bursts. Purple smoke boils across the street, tasting like burnt sugar and incense as it stings your eyes.`

On success: `You cover your face, and shoulder through the haze- bursting out with only watering eyes and a good story.`
On failure: `The world flashes negative— then nothing. You’re blinded till your turn ends, coughing through the fog as your speed is halved, a vendor’s voice echoing: “No refunds!”`

3) Thaylen Acrobat Troupe — Athletics DC 15 (success: tossed 30 ft; fail: Prone)
Setup: `Four Thaylen acrobats vault from poles to shoulders to a human tower, grinning as they cantilever right over you. One calls, “Arms up if you want the fast lane!”`

On success: `You leap— strong hands catch your waist and launch you in a perfect arc. You land thirty feet ahead in a stagger that becomes a sprint to delighted applause.`

On failure: `You mistime the jump; and accomplish chaos. You carom off a belly drum and hit cobbles prone, an acrobat peering down says to you, “Graceful attempt!”`

4) Spectral Dancers — Performance DC 15 (fail: lose 10 ft movement)
Setup: `The lane fills with spectral dancers— spren illusions of the honored dead in floating skirts. They waltz through lantern-light, faces kind, palms open, inviting you to join the step.`

On success: `A quick bow, two twirls, and you’re through the pattern—one dancer’s smile lingers like a blessing as you never break stride.`

On failure: `You try to thread the rhythm and get caught in the swirl; a translucent partner turns you—once, twice—until you spin free, losing 10 feet of movement and a little dignity.`

5) Vorin Procession — Lore: Religion DC 10 (success: bless/advantage next roll; fail: disadvantage next roll)
Setup: `A Vorin procession crosses, priests chanting in counterpoint, glow-spheres raised. Incense curls in bright skeins; banners whisper: Life before death.`

On success: `You dip and weave with proper reverence. A priest taps your brow with light. “Honor the journey.” Advantage on your next roll.`

On failure: `You misstep between lines; a priest snaps, “Defiler!” and the chorus swells like judgment. The weight of stares sticks to your heels—disadvantage on your next roll.`

### Ending the Chase
The chase ends if Teocín is caught, escapes, or the pursuers give up.

At the end of each round, Teocín makes an Agility (Stealth) test with advantage to slip away into the crowd. Compare to passive Perception of the pursuers.
- If the lead pursuer has Survival expertise, she loses advantage.
- If she has never broken line of sight, she automatically fails.
- If Teocín is caught, she bargains: "Serapio is at the metalworks. He'll protect me. He'll kill you."
- If she escapes, the pursuers glimpse a black raven circling overhead — Serapio's Midnight Essence wings — leading them to the metalworks anyway.

## Final Battle at the Metalworks
### Setting the Scene
```
Metal catwalks spiderweb over black slag pits. Scrap chulls slump in heaps beside twisted, glyph-etched plates. Two crane buckets dangle on chains, creaking as wind moans through cracked walls. From somewhere outside, a ribbon of incense smoke snakes in and curls along the floor.

High above, by a smashed safety lamp, a thin figure hunches on a catwalk—knees to chest. Around him, purple Sereno gathers and fades, deepening on a steady *thump* … *thump* like a heartbeat. Black, brittle "feathers" drift and catch on the railing.

Bootsteps ring from the outlet tunnel. Teocín steps into the light with a leather satchel and a spidery, caged implement—an inky needle held straight by etched rails and a little ticking coil.

Rufina's gemstone eyes glow warm as she enters with you. The honorspren hangs at Ludera's shoulder like a ribbon of pale stormlight, watching the pulse in the air.

Teocín says, "S-zero-one, return to baseline. We're going up for adjustments. Stand. Comply... Approach protocol: begin."

Serapio flinches as Teocín approaches. The black-violet ‘needle' in her cage shivers— once, twice— then ripples into beads and spatters the catwalk. "Storms" Teocín curses as she tosses the instrument aside, reaches for a red-tagged override plate… and the mist deepens on Serapio's pulse.
```

### Teocín's Intent & Voice
Belief: Serapio is a specimen; control is a math problem. She talks to him like a device: "Hold still," "stabilize," "respond."
Hubris: If she can just get close enough with her pattern-coupled implement or plate, she'll "reassert authority."
Blind spot: She dehumanizes Serapio and discounts the unknown.

### Phase 1 — "Hands Off Him, Teocín"
Frame: Hybrid scene: tense conversation + targeted actions under pressure, not yet a full brawl. Your goal is to strip Teocín's control and stabilize Serapio long enough that he doesn't tip into full Essence form.

Arena toys (use what's fun)
- Catwalk & chain-cranes: two hanging scrap bins (can swing, drop, or become cover).
- Incense braziers: feeding the constructs nearby; can be toppled or snuffed.
- Override plate/rod: Teocín's handheld pattern-coupled tool.
- Draft vents: a side door/fissure that spills a steady cross-breeze through the floor level.

#### Teocín's round-to-round:
- Approach Protocol: Moves along catwalks/gantries trying to line up her override plate or pattern-coupled tool on Serapio's chest (within ~10 ft).
- Control Ping (Action): Attempts a pattern sync (Lore/Mechanics vs a DC you set). On success she gains a 1-round edge (e.g., Serapio's DCs go up by 1, or the next PC helping him rolls at Disadvantage).
- Fallback: If blocked by draft or PC interference, she shifts position (drops a baffle, yanks a lever to close a vent, tosses a brazier smoke-screen).

#### Lines
Teocín: `Remove yourselves from my apparatus.`
Rufina: `We're people, not parts. He's not your tool.`

Teocín: `Tavern doll- identify your handler. Who is operating you?`
Rufina: `Stone, yes. Doll, no. I am Rufina— I pour my own drinks and my own decisions. I don't take scripts; I take orders— for food and juice. Who runs me? The same thing that should run you: conscience.`

Teocín: `Stabilize. Stand. Still.`
Rufina: `One step if you want it, Serapio. Not because she said.`

Teocín: `Control input rejected— unacceptable.`
Rufina: `Consent rejected— unacceptable.`

Teocín: `Do not assert will. Accept guidance.`
Rufina: `Will is life. We keep it safe here.`

Teocín: `Silence. You are introducing noise.`
Rufina: `Truth isn't noise. He needs to hear it.`

Teocín: `The model predicts compliance.`
Rufina: `People aren't models. He isn't yours.`

Teocín: `Stone unit, stand down or be reclaimed.`
Rufina: `Stone can choose, scholar. Watch me choose him.`

Teocín: `Incense code violet—comply.`
Rufina: `That smoke lies. Listen to your name instead.`

Teocín: `You're only stable when scripted.`
Rufina: `He's steady when respected.`

Teocín: `Sentiment is not a parameter.`
Rufina: `Care is. It's why we're here.`

Teocín: `Stand by for correction.`
Rufina: `Stand by for kindness.`

#### Honorspren 
to warrior:
- `If you mean to interpose, mean it.`
- `This air is full of lies and levers.`
- `Command without consent`
- `Guard the will, not the pattern.`
- `Protection first— argue second.`

during phase 1 persuasion/actions
- `Speak to the person, not the problem.`
- `Truth first; then tools.`
- `Help him choose, don't choose for him.`

when someone interposes or helps
- `Well placed.`
- `Shared weight is the shape of honor.`
- `You stepped between— remember why.`

when someone grandstands or lies
- `Say only what you can bear to live by.`
- `Words without intent are wind without pressure.`

when Serapio falters
- `His fear is honest. Meet honesty with honor.`
- `Hold him by choice, not by force.`
- `Name him, and let him name himself.`

when Teocín postures
- `She mistakes control for care.`
- `Instruction is not protection.`
- `A command without consent.`

#### How to resolve
Every meaningful dice roll involves the plot dice. Complications and Opportunites will go towards one of the 2 outcomes for this phase. Once one reaches 3- that outcome is selected.

Ways players can influence the situation:
- Disarm/disable the override (Athletics/Agility to knock it loose; Lore/Mechanics to jam its etch pattern; set DCs ~14–16).
- Second-hand Sereno to calm (Presence/Medicine; advantage if they use an infused chip for the analgesic "third form" they learned).
- Appeal to Serapio (Conversation: Empathy, Presence; bring up "you sleep where the draft is strongest," or "we can time our breath to your pulse").
- Environmental help (swing a bin to block line-of-sight, open the draft door to spoil Teocín's approach, knock a brazier to break the "script" lighting).
- A sharp humanizing line ("He is not your implement.") that lands.

Ways it can get worse:
- A chain snaps; brazier tips; haze thickens around Serapio.
- Helper gains Sereno exposure or loses Focus mid-assist.
- Teocín gets a partial latch (1 round of harder DCs).

#### If you hit 3 Opportunities first → Advantageous Start
The players have gained some trust from Serapio- so they will gain advantage when doing skills on his heart beat.

```
For a breath, the metalworks holds still. Serapio's eyes lock on yours, wet with fear but steady.
Rufina softly says, "Breathe with me, corazón. In… or out… you choose.""
Serapio hoarsely whispers, "I can't... help me."
```

#### If you hit 3 Complications first → Compromised Start
- Thicker Haze: For the first 2 rounds, the Sereno density imposes disadvantage (or –1 die) on Perception and Fortitude vs. choking.
- Early Scrap: Start Phase 2 with 2 Scraplings already animated at opposite piles.

```
Chains scream; a crane bucket lurches. Serapio flinches from every voice, curling tighter on the catwalk.
Rufina calls to him: "Serapio—name yourself!"
Serapio screams back: "Don't— don't touch me!"
```

### Phase 2 — "The Metalworks Wakes"
```
A pulse thunders through the room— *thump*... *thump*— and the purple mist in the air goes wine-dark.
From Serapio's shoulders and ribs, ink-black Essence boils outward, slick as tar and bright with a violet sheen.
It climbs and hardens in jagged plates; feathered blade-wings unfurl with a knife's whisper; chain-thin tendrils lash down the rails.
A nightmare shape stands where the boy sat, breathing fog.

Teocín screams at the party, "You did this— introducing noise into a stable system. You force me to regain control."

Sereno pours from the catwalks in a choking flood, rolling low and thick across the floor.
The Honorspren speaks to Ludera, "Do not breathe panic; breathe purpose."
```

Flip: The room floods with Sereno; Midnight Essence plates over most of Serapio—your Boss emerges. Damage splatter seeds the floor; when it hits scrap piles, Scraplings (Minions) animate and rush.

Complications examples: chain snaps; bin swings; brazier tips (haze spreads); floor gives way to a lower grate. Use Opportunities to reveal heartbeat windows

Honorspren (when phase begins): `Do not breathe panic; breathe purpose.`

Senses 40 ft. (sight; through Sereno he “feels” movement)

features
- Boss. Takes a fast and slow turn each round; can spend 1 focus after an enemy’s turn to use an extra action; can spend 1 focus on his turn to remove a condition.
- Essence Mantle. While a Sereno zone touches him, he gains +2 deflect and attacks against him beyond 10 ft. have disadvantage (blurred outline).
- Shard-Splash (Reaction). The first time each round Serapio takes 10+ damage from a single hit, a Midnight Scrapling appears in an empty space within 10 ft. (max 2 active).
- Broken Poise. If he starts a turn Afflicted or Disoriented, he loses 1 focus (the heartbeat stutters his pattern).

actions
- Strike: Essence Talons. Attack +8, reach 5 ft., one target. Graze: 6 (2d4) keen. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 8) keen; may push 5 ft.
- Winged Lunge. Move up to 30 ft. (ignoring gaps), then Essence Talons with advantage if he moved at least 15 ft. straight.
- Sereno Bloom (Costs 1 Focus). A 10-ft.-radius haze within 60 ft. becomes thick until the end of his next slow turn; creatures that start in or enter the haze must pass DC 15 Discipline or become Disoriented until end of their next turn and take 5 spirit.
- Heartbeat Pulse (Costs 2 Focus). 15-ft. cone; DC 15 Athletics or be pushed 10 ft. and Prone. If pushed into scrap, a Scrapling may animate (GM: 50/50).

opportunities & complications
- Opportunity. Sync to his heartbeat—reduce his deflect by 2 until the start of his next turn, or prevent Shard-Splash this round.
- Complication. Essence surges; immediately create a 10-ft. Sereno Bloom centered on him.

Tactics: Opens with Sereno Bloom to debuff, uses Winged Lunge to isolate a target on catwalks, and relies on Shard-Splash to box the party in. When pressured, he spends focus to clear conditions or pop a Heartbeat Pulse to throw PCs off ledges.

#### Rufina
- Once per scene, she can mirror the party's chosen oath stance with a lesser effect.

to Serapio (comforting, humanizing)
- `Breathe with me, corazón. In… or out… you choose.`
- `You're not a pattern— you're a person. Look at me.`
- `Hold to the beat that's yours, not hers.`
- `Mi niño, take the lane they opened. Go.`
- `You are allowed to be afraid and still choose.`
- `Name yourself. Out loud. Make the mist listen.`

to Teocín (firm, cutting)
- `He's not your tool, scholar. He's someone's son.`
- `You can etch rails on stone, not on a will.`
- `Your numbers don't fit people.`
- `Control is not care. You've forgotten the difference.`
- `You hear a metronome; I hear a heartbeat.`

to the party (tactical nudges)
- `Now—on the beat! Step through!`
- `Open that vent; I'll fan the lane!`
- `Left pile's waking—cut it off at the rails!`
- `If you must get hurt, do it for a reason. Not for her.`

when the mist surges / windows open
- `Lanterns low—eyes up! The color deepens before it grabs.`
- `There! The purple fades—your moment. Go!`
- `Feel that tug? That's where it's thinnest.`

when someone falters / is grabbed
- `Take my hand; I don't breathe, but I won't let you go.`
- `Drop low—let it pass over you.`
- `I'll draw its eyes; you free his arm.`

when the warrior starts speaking the Words
- `Say it like you mean to live it.`
- `Good—bind it to action.`
- `Finish it, and I'll hold the door a heartbeat longer.`

after each Oath line (call-and-response flavor)
- (Life before death) `Then stand between him and the next blow.`
- (Strength before weakness) `Share the weight—tie the knot.`
- (Journey before destination) `One step, then the next. With him.`

when Teocín's gadgets appear
- `Nails in the posts—two out and the cage falls!`
- `That smoke sings ‘comply.' Don't.`

when Teocín dies / boss overclocks
- `Storms… she chose control over care—and paid for it.`
- `Hold fast. The shape just got meaner.`

when addressing other constructs / self-awareness
- `Stone can choose, too. Watch me.`
- `I am Rufina. Remember it.`

morale & heart
- `We keep each other. That's the work.`
- `You don't owe her obedience—you owe yourself tomorrow.`
- `I am not alive as you are, but I am living. So are you.`

light humor / tavern-keeper bite (sparingly)
- `House rule: no grappling the guests.`
- `First round's on me—if we leave with our limbs.`

closing lines (save for end-beats)
- (If Serapio saved) `See? Your name fits you again.`
- (If tragedy) `I will keep a lantern for him, even if I cannot weep.`

#### Teocín's Round Script in Phase 2 (until she dies or flees)
- Skirt & Command: She keeps to catwalk edges, shouting dehumanizing cues ("Subject—return to baseline. Comply.") that give the Boss a 1-time +1 on its next control attempt if unanswered by a PC (any free action retort cancels it).
- Approach Lunge: If safe lanes aren't open, she drops baffles or uses smoke to get close for a Jack-In attempt; that attempt is what tips the Complication meter toward her death if it accumulates.
- Desperation: Once the Oath fires, she doubles down ("Irreproducible variables—remove them!") and tries to use a secondary plate; if Comp=3 hasn't happened yet, this is likely the push that does it.

To Serapio (cold commands)
- `S-01, return to baseline. Comply.`
- `Hold the phase. Do not sing.`
- `Stabilize your pulse. Now!`
- `You're a pattern with a heartbeat—act like one.`
- `Stand. Still.`
- `Do not assert will. Accept guidance.`
- `Your purpose is to respond, not decide.`

To Rufina (unbelieving)
- `You're just a script puppet— Your fragment should mimic, not decide.`
- `You're outside your ofrenda radius; autonomy is impossible.`
- `False positive on ‘will.' Return to script. Await instruction from your operator.`
- `There was no parameter for mercy— who added it?`
- `Stone does not choose, you are malfunctioning. You obey ofrendas, not ethics.`
- `Ancestral echo, stand down. Your handler can reclaim you.`
- `Stop pretending at personhood and await command.`

Technical mutters (to herself)
- `Variance spike… anchor the rails.`
- `Phase drift at every thump—irritating.`
- `Contact loss on the beat; re-route the pattern.`
- `Cadence Violet isn't holding—adjust ratio.`
- `Field strength nominal; subject noncompliant.`
- `The model predicts control. The model is correct.`
- `Negative feedback loop… I will close it.`

To the party (dismissive, dehumanizing)
- `Remove yourselves from my apparatus.`
- `You're adding noise to an elegant solution.`
- `Sentiment is not a control input.`
- `You can't argue a waveform into obedience.`
- `Every second you delay me, he becomes less usable.`
- `The stone dolls obeys better than any of you.`

When the team counters (vents, gales, smashing gear)
- `Seal that draft! Who opened the crossflow?`
- `Do not touch the lattice— operator only!`
- `Sabotage noted. Recalibrating around your vandalism.`
- `You broke one node; the field persists.`
- `Unacceptable interference. You are variables, not actors.`

When the heartbeat ruins her control
- `I did not authorize that rhythm.`
- `Hold the pattern—stop that pulse.`
- `Every thump corrupts the rails… infuriating.`
- `Your heart is not a metronome; make it one.`

When Scraplings spawn / Boss surges
- `Yes— aggregate. Use the rails I've given you.`
- `Good. Propagate along the lines.`
- `Accept instruction; move as one.`

When the warrior begins speaking the Words
- `Empty catechism won't alter the phase.`
- `Recitals don't change physics.`
- `Silence your slogans; they are not parameters.`

#### Boss kit
Attacks:
- Scrap Claw (cone) → on hit, spawns 1 Scrapling at the edge of a scrap pile.
- Wing Buffet (line) → creates a Sereno haze zone (lightly obscured, choking on failed save).
- Override Lash (single-target) → on Opportunity, it tries to grapple with Essence rails.

Weakness windows: Timed to his heartbeat; actions synchronized to the beat can open gaps (advantage on attack or a free Disengage through Essence).

#### Scraplings (Minions)
Look: squirming knots of tar-slick chain, a tin mask for a face.
Rules: treat as Tier-appropriate Minions; 1 hit → injury → defeated; they can't crit. (Exactly as per role guidance. )
Behavior: climb, harry, set up flanks; a pile can "erupt" for dramatic beats when the Boss takes big damage.

#### 3 Complications
Each complication can be spent to advance Teocín's quest to gain control (though it will end with her accidental death). Her final words sting so hard that they power up the boss.

1) Pulse Cage Nails (embedded anchors)
What it is: Thumb-size etched spikes she rapid-fires into pillars/catwalks; thin rails lace between them, forming a field cage.
```
From the catwalk, Teocín whips a palm-sized launcher and a tat-tat-tat of thumb-long nails bites into posts and railing; hair-thin etch-lines ignite between them, sketching a rigid lattice that hums on Serapio's thump… thump.
"Anchors out—lock phase on my mark." Teocin says. "Subject S-01, hold still!"

The new rails throw knife-straight shadows across the haze; where they cross, the Midnight Essence stiffens, tendrils drawn taut toward the glowing lines, and the air itself seems to tug at your boots as if the floor has learned to pull.
The cage cinches with the next heartbeat, a low chord vibrating through metal and bone. Teocín's eyes flash as she leans over the pattern. "Field engaged… but your heartbeat keeps corrupting the pattern." Furious, she screams at Serapio, "You're not a person— you're a pattern with a pulse!"
```

2) Incense Codes (command smoke)
What it is: Pre-measured incense cartridges with control ratios. She clips one to a brazier and lights—smoke carries a "stand/comply" cadence.
```
Teocín snaps a brass cartridge into a brazier and strikes a spark; a coil flares, and a tight stream of violet-sheened smoke spools out in even puffs, each the same length, the same beat.

“Code Violet, cadence ‘comply.’" She empties another cartridge into the brazier. "Breathe as instructed, S-01.”

The scent is sharp— resin and metal— the smoke doesn’t drift so much as march, braiding through the Sereno and laying faint rings around ankles and rails. Wherever it passes, the Midnight Essence straightens— tendrils align, plates settle, and the floor seems to urge: "stillness, stand, comply."

For a moment the room ticks to her metronome— until Serapio’s thump… thump cuts across it, the pulse swelling and smearing the neat rings into ragged waves. Teocín’s lips thin as she feeds another to the brazier. “Response partial. S-01, hold still. Tools don’t resist!”
```

3) Jack-In
Convinced control is inches away, she jams an override plate directly into the Essence mass at Serapio's chest. Being so close to serapio, a spike of midnight essence slams through her chest- letting her speak just a few last words.
```
Teocín rips the override plate from her satchel— etched rails glinting, the caged needle trembling— and storms along the catwalk toward the boy. “Enough variables! Direct override— I decide the shape!" She drives the plate hard into the seething mass at Serapio’s chest. "Not you!" She drives it in deeper. "Not them!!" Deeper. "OBEY!!!”

For a beat the lattice locks— lines flare, the metronome coil screams— the Midnight Essence answers with a convulsive thrust. At that moment, a black-violet spike punches through Teocín's chest and the rail behind her with a wet, ringing sound; she jerks, feet skidding, the world holding its breath.
The honorspren’s voice cuts cold and clear: “Marks on skin are not marks on will.”

Teocín staggers, fingers still welded to the plate. A ribbon of purple mist escapes her mouth as she gasps, eyes wide with disbelief. “S-01, you’re a cage for my work— nothing more…" Her knees buckle. "I decide— if you are alive…” She slides off the spike, leaving a dark smear, and collapses in a rattle of tools. The override plate doesn’t fall with her— its frame fuses into the Essence with a molten hiss, sinking as a jagged sigil over Serapio’s sternum.

The room turns. The sigil pulses— thump… THUMP— and the Essence surges, climbing in armored plates that hook like barbs. Feathered shadows blade into wings; talons extrude from scrap, knitting chain and chull-plating into claws. Tendrils thicken and whip along the rails; every strike throws off splatter that crawls toward the piles, where scrap shudders and rises on new, skittering limbs. Sereno erupts from the catwalk in a choking flood, rolling low and heavy; vision narrows to violet and steel. Metal hums with a predator’s breath.

The honorspren steadies at Ludera's shoulder. “The shape grows crueler- but We do not." It looks her squarely in teh eyes. "Her hubris paid its due— now pay yours with courage.”
```

#### 3 Opportunites
Each opportunity rolled can be spent on the warrior saying 1 of the lines of their first ideal.

Effect upon speaking the final words:
- Flesh: first incoming boss blow this round can be interposed with half damage + you draw a Sereno hazard off an ally.
- Stone: you bondknot two allies (or an ally + Serapio) for 2 rds: +1 Defense; ignore first forced move each round; once, prevent a drop-to-0 → drop to 1.
- Crack: you open a 10-ft lane for 2 rds: mists/tendrils suppressed, grapples auto-break on entry; one ally slides 10 ft on Opportunity.

##### First ideal choices
Honorspren: `This place lies. Stand where your heart is true. Decide what you'll suffer for."`

as the warrior begins the Oath (each line)
- (Life before death) `Then stand between hurt and the helpless.`
- (Strength before weakness) `Lend what you have, not what you pretend.`
- (Journey before destination) `Walk beside and do not drag.`

after the Oath ignites: `Your promise has edges— use them. We are one wind; keep steady.`

###### Flesh (will & vulnerability)
Words:
- To protect life before death, I step into pain so another will keeps breathing.
- Setting strength before weakness, I lend mine when theirs is gone, that their choice endures.
- Keeping journey before destination, I walk beside them until their steps are their own.

Battle Boon — Interpose the Living Will (choice-tied, 1/round):
When a living creature you can reach would take damage, you may use your reaction to move up to 10 ft (no Reactive Strike) and take half of that damage instead. If the stakes are raised and you roll a Complication on this protection, you do not lose Focus from that Complication (you still resolve the base test).

Why it fits: you literally hurt so another keeps choosing—the oath's meaning becomes your move. (Uses Focus/Complication/Advantage concepts from the core rules.)

###### Stone (bonds, continuity, shared weight)
Words:
- With life before death held in our bonds, I guard the memory that keeps us standing.
- Setting strength before weakness, I tie my oath to theirs so the weight is carried together.
- With journey before destination, I preserve the ties that make tomorrow possible.

Battle Boon — Bondknot Anchor (once per scene, lasts 2 rounds):
As a bonus action, you "tie a bondknot" linking you and up to two willing creatures within 10 ft. Until your second next turn:
- Each linked creature gains +1 Defense and ignores the first forced movement against them each round.
- Once during the effect, if a linked creature would drop to 0 Health, they instead drop to 1 Health and the bondknot ends.
- If you roll a Complication while maintaining the bondknot, you lose 1 Focus (shared weight) but the knot persists.

Why it fits: this isn't a "wall"; it's shared endurance and continuity—bonds keep people upright, just like memory sustains Rufina and tradition sustains the town.

###### The Crack (making room for consent)
Words:
- Where breath and bond collide, I make room for life before death to be chosen, not imposed.
- Placing strength before weakness, I clear the way so a will is heard, not commanded.
- Keeping journey before destination, I guard the path without deciding where it must lead.

Battle Boon — Gale of the Between (make room, once per scene):
As an action, choose a point within 30 ft; a 10-ft radius gale erupts, lasting until the start of your next turn.
- You choose which creatures can occupy the zone; all other creatures in it must pass an Agility (DC 14) test or are pushed 10 ft to its edge and can't re-enter until the gale ends.
- The gale parts mists and tendrils (Sereno/essence hazards in the zone are suppressed for its duration), and breaks grapples/restraints on creatures you choose when they enter.
- If you roll an Opportunity while creating the gale, you may slide one ally 10 ft through the cleared space.

Why it fits: it literally makes room—a Windrunner-flavored burst of Adhesion/pressure that opens a path and protects consent.

# Aftermath
## Common Beat (read in all cases)
```
The last blow lands— the metalworks shudders— and the Midnight Essence breaks its cadence. Plates crack or slough, tendrils withdraw along dark rails, and the Sereno drains like a low tide, leaving incense and rust. Chains settle. The echo of a heartbeat fades into the bones of the building.

The honorspren quiet whispers, “We held to will. Remember why... Today, the wind carried vows.”
```

## If Serapio Lives
`The essence peels from Serapio's chest in tarry sheets. A boy remains— shaking, ash-black residue on his hands.`

### Rufina alive (add):
`Rufina reaches him, stone fingers careful. “Breathe with me, corazón. In… or out… by your choice.”`
`He meets her gaze and nods once, the smallest yes- and the room seems larger for it.`

### Rufina dead (add):
`He stares at the stones that were Rufina— two gemstone eyes dull in the dust— and makes a tiny sound that is not quite a sob. “She… chose,” he whispers, as if testing the word.`

### Teocín alive (add):
`Teocín’s eyes skitter over him, then to the residue on the floor. “Instability…" she mutters. "salvageable data.”`
`The Honorspren firmly says “You named a person ‘subject’ and called it care.”`
(Let the table decide her fate— bindings, escape, or arrest).

### Teocín dead (add):
`Teocín's body lies where the spike left her; the fused plate on the catwalk is a black sigil cooling to gray.`
`The Honorspren to everyone: “Alive is breath; living is choosing. Today he chose— and we stood guard.”`

## If Serapio Dies
`The essence hardens, fractures, and falls in dull plates. When the fog thins, the body on the catwalk is still. The violet in the air loosens its grip and slips away. The honorspren sighs, "The truth hurts; but do not lie."`

### Rufina alive (add):
`Rufina kneels as if she could tuck a blanket around a memory. “I am stone, and I grieve,” she says, eyes steady. “We failed his choice, but not the truth of it.”`

### Rufina dead (add):
`The dust of Rufina's painted smile lies near his hand— two losses within arm’s reach. Wind finds the cracks and sets the chains to a slow, unhappy music.`

### Teocín alive (add):
`Teocín stares at the stillness, jaw tight. “Unstable to the end,” she says, as if writing a note.`
`The honorspren sharply replies: “Dehumanize a person, and you will call their will a flaw.”`

### Teocín dead (add):
`Two bodies. One with breath spent, one with hubris quieted. The room refuses to say which cost more.`
`The honorspren to everyone, “We call stone alive when it mimics us; we call people tools when they resist us. Remember which is which.”`

## Closing Button (use once you’ve read the relevant branches)
`A last ribbon of Sereno leaks through a broken pane and is gone. What remains are choices— made, missed, or mourned—and the work of living with them.`
